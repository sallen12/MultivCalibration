Title: Evaluate the calibration of multivariate probabilistic forecasts
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person(given = "Sam", family = "Allen", email = "sam.allen@unibe.ch", role = c("cre", "aut"))
Description: An R package that provides tools to evaluate the calibration of 
    multivariate probabilistic forecasts. Several prerank functions are provided
    that condense the multivariate forecasts and observations to univariate 
    objects, to which univariate checks for calibration can be employed.
