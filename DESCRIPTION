Description: An R package that provides tools to evaluate the calibration of 
    multivariate probabilistic forecasts. This includes suggested pre-rank functions
    to condense multivariate forecasts to univariate forecasts, as well as tools
    to visualise the resulting calibration using multivariate rank histograms. 
    Tools to test for the flatness of a histogram are also included.
